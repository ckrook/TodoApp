# TodoApp

### Summary
This a minimalistic Todo App I built as part of a school project in November 2021.

### Objectives
The objectives where to build a simple todo app <br>with the possibility to sort the todos by **deadline**, **priority** and **alphabetical**.<br>
The end user also needed to be able to mark the todos as **done** as well as **delete** them.

### Tools
For the project, I worked with the following tools:<br>
_Html, Sass, Typescript, Tailwind, Parcel, Cypress_

### Styling
When it comes to styling my choice of framework was Tailwind. <br>
This because Tailwind is widly used in the industry.<br>

### Testing
With test driven developing getting more important these days, I built my tests using Cypress.
This was I could make sure that the app passed key tests before I deployed it as finished.
